# Bank Loan Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer's loan application will be approved or not. I employed supervised learning algorithms and performed cross-validation using five different algorithms: SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Among these, SVM achieved the highest accuracy of 88% and demonstrated strong performance based on the F1 score metric
